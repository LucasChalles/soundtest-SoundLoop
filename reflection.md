This the first attmept at using a loop in my chords project.  I have accomplished a couple of things in this project.  I can play different chords depending on which key is pressed (1, 2, 3, or 4,).  And I also have programmed a set of chords to play in a sequence when the 5 key is pressed.  Where I had trouble is implementing the SoundLoop function in p5.Sound.  It is a much more complex function that serves a purpose a little different than what I am going for in my project.
